## üßê Thoughts

This was my first experience using Hapi; typically Express is my go-to framework. As this was a Node assessment, I figured using a new framework would allow me to rely more on my knowledge of the Node runtime then it did on library-specific code. All-in-all I was pretty happy with Hapi- I thought the out-of-the-box caching was a nice feature.

I intentionally kept things (file structure, task runners, compilers, etc.) simple. If I was to continue working on this project, I would probably migrate from the request HTTP client to a HTTP/2 solution (I believe this would speed things up a bit, since it would allow for concurrent requests on the same connection, but then again, I'm not sure if GitHub's endpoints is compatible).
